"""Add sample id as column to CGI data.

Assumptions:
- one sample per input file

This script can be run standalone:
   cat masterVarBeta-GS000010426-ASM.tsv | ./cgi-mapper.py

Or via the debugger:
   python -mpdb ./cgi-mapper.py masterVarBeta-GS000010426-ASM.tsv

To have the sample id correctly parsed when input is from stdin, set the 
environment variable that Hadoop would set:
   export map_input_file=./hu34D5B9/masterVarBeta-GS000015891-ASM.tsv.bz2
   bzcat ./hu34D5B9/masterVarBeta-GS000015891-ASM.tsv.bz2 | ./cgi-mapper.py

To have the sample id correctly parsed when input is from a file, ensure that it
is in the file path:
   python -mpdb ./cgi-mapper.py hu34D5B9/masterVarBeta-GS000015891-ASM.tsv

It can also be run as a mapper-only Hadoop Streaming job:
  hadoop jar /path/to/your/hadoop-streaming-*.jar -input inputpath \
  -mapper cgi-mapper.py -file cgi-mapper.py --numReduceTasks 0 \
  -output outputpath

TODO(deflaux):
 - field relativeCoverageDiploid contains some values that are 'N', consider
   converting those values to null
 - consider converting zero-based positions to one-based positions if we
   find that most annotations are one-based
