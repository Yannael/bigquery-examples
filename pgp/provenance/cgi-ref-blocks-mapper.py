"""Add extract reference-matching records from CGI data and conver to VCF.

Assumptions:
- one sample per input file


This script can be run standalone:
   cat masterVarBeta-GS000016446-ASM.tsv | ./cgi-ref-blocks-mapper.py

Or via the debugger:
   python -mpdb ./cgi-ref-blocks-mapper.py masterVarBeta-GS000016446-ASM.tsv

To have the sample id correctly parsed when input is from stdin, set the 
environment variable that Hadoop would set:
   export map_input_file=./huDBF9DD/masterVarBeta-GS000016446-ASM.tsv.bz2
   bzcat ./huDBF9DD/masterVarBeta-GS000016446-ASM.tsv.bz2 | ./cgi-ref-blocks-mapper.py

To have the sample id correctly parsed when input is from a file, ensure that it
is in the file path:
   python -mpdb ./cgi-mapper.py ./huDBF9DD/masterVarBeta-GS000016446-ASM.tsv

It should be run as a mapper-only Hadoop Streaming job:
  hadoop jar /path/to/your/hadoop-streaming-*.jar \
  -libjars /home/deflaux/custom.jar \
  -outputformat com.custom.CustomMultiOutputFormat \
  -mapper cgi-ref-blocks-mapper.py -file cgi-ref-blocks-mapper.py \
  --numReduceTasks 0 -input inputpath -output outputpath

Notice that there is a special output format to put the VCF header
back into the output files including the specific sample id.
