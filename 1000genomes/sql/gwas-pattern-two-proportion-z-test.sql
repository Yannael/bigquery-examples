# An example of a pattern one might use for GWAS queries upon 1,000
# Genomes variants.  It is specifically examining differences allelic
# frequency for variants upon chromosome 12 between the EAS super
# population versus all other individuals, returning a ranked list of
# variants by decreasing variation between groups.  Note that this
# particular query below is naive in many, many respects and is merely
# meant as an over-simplified example that might help domain experts
# translate their scientifically correct data filtering and
# statistical methods to BigQuery.  Feedback to improve this query is
# most welcome!
