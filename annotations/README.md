Annotations
============

A handful of annotation databases have been loaded to BigQuery for prototyping purposes.

See [provenance](./provenance) for details on the source of this data and how it may have been transformed prior to loading to BigQuery.

See the [Annotation JOINs](../1000genomes/data-stories/annotation-joins) data story for a few examples of how these tables can be used with variant data.
