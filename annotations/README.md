Annotations
============

__*Note:* Tute Genomics has provided an excellent table of annotations for hg19 SNPs.  Please see [Google Genomics Public Data](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/public-data#community) for more detail.__


A handful of annotation databases have been loaded to BigQuery for prototyping purposes.

See [provenance](./provenance) for details on the source of this data and how it may have been transformed prior to loading to BigQuery.

See the [Annotation JOINs](../1000genomes/data-stories/annotation-joins) data story for a few examples of how these tables can be used with variant data.
